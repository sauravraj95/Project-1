# Project-1-Forkify-App-
JavaScript ES6/ES7 Project

1. This is a simple webpage developed by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

2. For creating this app I have used other development resources like Webpack, Babel and also use few third party from gitHub.

3. In this app we use API which was provided by https://www.food2fork.com/ (free virsion- limited calling).

4. Asynchronous JavaScript used : Async and await AJAX calling used for API calling/handling.

5. Many modern methods of ES6 and ES6+ are also included in this project.

6. you can simply clone whole reposetry or except for node_model and just use package.json for installing npm, as I have included node_model also for the convenience.
